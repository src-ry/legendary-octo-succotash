# Licenses
Liceenses here have not been reviewed by the OSI and therefore not classified as open-source licensing.

## Zeppelin License
Designed mostly for the needs of my projects, purpose of this license is to allow users to use the code with minimal restrictions whilst giving the origin of the source credit. It finds inspiration from the Apache License, the zlib license, MIT License, however it is mostly written by hand. I might submit for review with the OSI. Amazing! 

In short:
* All of your contributions are submitted under the terms of the license
* Don't be a dick, don't say you made a project if you didn't, don't say you wrote a project if you didn't, don't say somewhere else is the origin for whatever derivative you have.
* A derivative must disclose the source and license, unless in binary form, where only source disclosure is required.
* Don't use the names of the product, project members or whatever for false endorsement of a project if they don't give permission.
* Don't modify the license for fucks sake.

Congratulations! You now know the terms of the license.

## Sharing is Caring License
Genuinely do not use this license holy crap. Made for fun. It probably lacks legal merits too! Great!
